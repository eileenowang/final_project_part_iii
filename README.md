1st data source: [World Happiness 2019 Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2019.csv)

2nd data source:[The Association between Social Support and Happiness among Elderly in Iran](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056407/)

# Part III - Intended audience for my data story
While my data story is about finding happiness for elderly, it is not meant to be told to elderly people. My personal inspiration that led me to tell this data story are my grandparents. I wanted to take this opportunity to learn about what I might do to help my grandparents find happiness in their old age. 

The data story is meant to be for individuals who have elderly figures in their lives whom they care about. My target persona is a young person in his/her 20-30s, who is unable to see their grandparents on a regular basis due to being at school or work. As someone who is busy with school/career, he/she wants to know what are some tangible, immediate things they could do to help their grandparents be happy even when they are not there. 

To help my target persona reach their goal of finding and instilling happiness to the elderly they care about, in my final project I will 1) Identify and define the exact kind of support my target persona needs to provide, and 2) Provide the "how" - as in drawing attention to services that can offer the support. 

# Part III - Work done so far 

A few paragraphs that summarize the work you've done so far.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)

Initially in part I, I started from a big-picture perspective - looking at what influences happiness at a global level through the Happiness Report 2019. In order to help me focus on which of the 6 main factors matter, I created a map that visually showed the main key driver of happiness for many nations.
