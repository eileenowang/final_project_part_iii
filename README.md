# Project Overview

The story I am trying to tell is in 3 phases: 1) Why we should care about elderly happiness, 2) Exploring what contributes to happiness, and finally 3) How can we help the elderly we know pursue happiness.

# Part III - Intended audience for my data story
While my data story is about finding happiness for elderly, it is not meant to be told to elderly people. My personal inspiration that led me to tell this data story are my grandparents. I wanted to take this opportunity to learn about what I might do to help my grandparents find happiness in their old age. 

The data story is meant to be for individuals who have elderly figures in their lives whom they care about. My target persona is a young person in his/her 20-30s, who is unable to see their grandparents on a regular basis due to being at school or work. As someone who is busy with school/career, he/she wants to know what are some tangible, immediate things they could do to help their grandparents be happy even when they are not there. 

To help my target persona reach their goal of finding and instilling happiness to the elderly they care about, in my final project I will 1) Identify and define the exact kind of support my target persona needs to provide, and 2) Provide the "how" - as in drawing attention to services that can offer the support. 

# Part III - Work done so far 

Initially in Part I, I started with a big-picture perspective - looking at what influences happiness at a global level through the Happiness Report 2019. I created an interactive map that is designed to ignite curiousity in my target persona to learn about happiness. When I showed this to a friend for feedback, he said "I'm not sure I'm learning anything about happiness from this map, other than Denmark is the most happy nation. And I'm not from Denmark, so..." This is when I decided I needed a second map, to help my target persona focus on the main factor mattered the most for each nation. It ended up being a productive design decision, because it showed that social support is by far the most common driving factor of happiness for many nations. My classmates in Storytelling with Data also encouraged me to introduce a second data set at this point, to 1) dig deeper into what social support encompasses, 2) find more data points that had stronger ties with elderly happiness. 

With my 2nd data set and in Part II, I focused on tying together my story and identifying data visualization opportunities that would be impactful. After discussing with my peers during the 2nd round of feedback in Storytelling with data class, I decided that a infographic, calling out the most important data point from the source (25% of variability in happiness is explained by 2 kinds of support- informational and emotional support) would be the most effective design decision for this 2nd dataset. Initially I was thinking of creating a chart that compared standartized coefficients and p-values to compare the different kinds of support. My classmates gave me a feedback that this chart prioritizes metrics that may not be intuitive to understand for a general audience. And therefore a simple infographic would make the most sense here. 

Lastly, in order to strengthen the tie between the data I visualize and the story I'm trying to tell, I thought it was really important for me to first establish why we should care about elderly happiness. Beyond the elderly people we personally know, the world is also aging rapidly. This led me to find data points on what the status quo is (9% of the world is elderly in 2019) vs. the future (16% of the world in 2050 will be elderly). I created 2 pie charts and infographics to illustrate this point.
